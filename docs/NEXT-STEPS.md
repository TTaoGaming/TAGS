‚ö†Ô∏è **STATUS CHECK**: MediaPipe CDN scripts are already loaded in current system, but HandsFree.js is actively used.

#### **Step 1.2: Data Pipeline Conversion (ARCHIVED)**
- [ ] Convert `getCurrentPositionFromHandsFree()` to `getCurrentPositionFromMediaPipe()`
- [ ] Update 3D landmark extraction to use MediaPipe's true 3D coordinates
- [ ] Add compatibility shim for legacy HandsFree calls during transition

#### **Step 1.3: Testing & Validation (ARCHIVED)**
- [ ] Create side-by-side comparison tool (HandsFree vs MediaPipe)
- [ ] Validate gesture accuracy improvements
- [ ] Test performance impact on target devices
- [ ] Ensure all existing functionality works with new pipeline

#### **Step 1.4: Production Deployment (ARCHIVED)**
- [ ] Gradual rollout with feature flag
- [ ] Monitor performance metrics
- [ ] Collect user feedback on accuracy improvements
- [ ] Complete migration and remove HandsFree.js dependencies

### **Phase 2: Advanced Features (ARCHIVED MEDIUM PRIORITY)**
**Status**: Architecture ready (VERIFIED)
**Timeline**: 3-4 weeks after MediaPipe migration (ARCHIVED TIMELINE)
**Benefits**: Professional-grade capabilities, market differentiation

#### **Step 2.1: Occupational Therapy Integration (ARCHIVED)**
- [ ] Research evidence-based hand therapy protocols (AOTA standards)
- [ ] Implement ROM (Range of Motion) tracking with clinical accuracy
- [ ] Add ball squeeze exercise simulations with pressure feedback
- [ ] Create progress tracking with standardized assessment metrics
- [ ] Integrate AR overlay showing current vs ideal hand positions

#### **Step 2.2: Multi-Instrument Spatial Switching (ARCHIVED)**
- [ ] Implement 3D zones for different instruments
- [ ] Add smooth transitions between instrument spaces
- [ ] Create visual feedback for zone boundaries
- [ ] Optimize performance for real-time switching

#### **Step 2.3: Enhanced 3D Visualization (ARCHIVED)**
- [ ] Upgrade anchor visualization with true 3D depth
- [ ] Add perspective-correct rendering
- [ ] Implement hand shadow/depth cues
- [ ] Create immersive AR-style overlays

### **Phase 3: Ecosystem Expansion (ARCHIVED FUTURE)**
**Status**: Foundation established (VERIFIED)
**Timeline**: 1-2 months after Phase 2 (ARCHIVED TIMELINE)
**Benefits**: Platform expansion, revenue opportunities

#### **Step 3.1: Cloud Features (ARCHIVED)**
- [ ] Multi-user collaboration sessions
- [ ] Cloud-based settings sync
- [ ] Performance analytics dashboard
- [ ] Remote therapy session support

#### **Step 3.2: Platform Integration (ARCHIVED)**
- [ ] Native mobile apps (iOS/Android)
- [ ] Desktop applications (Electron)
- [ ] VR/AR headset support
- [ ] Professional DAW plugins
