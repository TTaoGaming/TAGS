actually let's discuess the orchestrator. what is it doing. do I have good documentation on the logic? the idea is a event based decoupled system with microservice like architecture that my orchestrator can use. can you help me verify and understand what is actually happening?

Below is a proven “minimal-friction” recipe that makers use to turn a projector + webcam pair into a touch-style surface, followed by concrete triggering options and the best open-source code bases to fork.

1 · Hardware & Layout
Item	Why it matters	Quick tip
Rigid mount for cam & projector	Homography stays valid only if nothing shifts.	Build a single L-shaped bracket or bolt the webcam to the projector chassis.
Matte surface (white paper, foam-core, or tabletop paint)	Increases contrast, cuts specular glare.	Your polarization trick helps, but diffuse paint is simpler.
Even light	Hand tracking hates deep shadows.	Add a cheap LED strip facing the table edge.

2 · One-Time Calibration Flow
Goal: find a 3 × 3 homography that maps camera pixels → projector pixels.

Project a high-contrast pattern (checkerboard or grid of circles).

Capture a frame with the webcam.

Detect pattern corners (OpenCV’s findChessboardCorners or findCirclesGrid).

Solve findHomography → H matrix.

Store H in localStorage so users calibrate only once unless hardware moves.

Ready-made code

Repo	Language	Why fork it
bytedeco/procamcalib	Java / Kotlin + OpenCV	CLI & GUI routines for geometric + color calibration. 
github.com
kamino410/procam-calibration	Python + OpenCV	Very small, single-script calibration with chessboard/gray-code. Good to read and port to JS. 
github.com
La Tabla (chaimgingold/Tabla)	C++/openFrameworks	Complete tabletop interaction stack; shows how homography drives touch events. 
github.com
hackster.io
PapARt	Java/Processing	Projection-mapping toolkit; has an interactive “click four corners” wizard you can copy. 
github.com
single-shot-pro-cam-calib	C++	Fast “one picture” method—handy if you need frequent re-cal. 
github.com

JS port note: You can perform steps 2-4 entirely in the browser with opencv.js; all that changes is syntax.

3 · Mapping finger coordinates to on-screen controls
js
Copy code
// camX,camY = fingertip in webcam pixels
const [projX, projY, projW] = math.multiply(H, [camX, camY, 1]);
const x = projX / projW, y = projY / projW;   // projector-space coords
Draw eight rectangular “pads” in projector space.

After homography transform, hit-test (x, y) against those pads.

4 · “Touch down / up” strategies
Option	What counts as down	Pros	Cons	Recommendation
Ignore Z (2-D only)	Pinch detected and (x,y) in a pad.	Works with a single RGB cam; simplest.	No pressure/hover info.	Start here—fastest path to demo.
Pseudo-depth via hand scale	Compare current hand‐bbox height to boxed “calibration spread”.	No extra sensors.	Sensitive to camera zoom changes, kids’ small hands.	OK for hobby use.
Finger flexion (MediaPipe)	Finger’s DIP joint angle < threshold = “pressed”.	Independent of table height; robust against shadows/glare.	Some false triggers when gesturing above table.	Good upgrade after basic demo.
Stereo or RealSense depth	Finger Z < 2 cm above surface.	True hover/pressure; future-proof.	Extra camera hardware.	Only if you need velocity/aftertouch later.

For your eight-note music pads the “ignore-Z + pinch” method feels natural: pinch to start note, un-pinch ends it.

5 · Triggering the sound
js
Copy code
if (pinchStart && inPad) {
  midiOut.noteOn(channel, padNote, 100);   // velocity 100
}
if (pinchEnd) {
  midiOut.noteOff(channel, padNote, 0);
}
Add a 150 ms envelope tail for sustained instruments so letting go feels like releasing a real key.

Drums: one-shot, no noteOff needed.

6 · “Zero-friction” user setup you can ship
Click “Calibrate” → projector flashes pattern → user presses space when pattern fully visible.

Software auto-detects corners, solves H, shows green overlay for confirmation.

User hits “Save”; pads appear; start pinching.

Time-to-music in under 30 seconds is the wow-factor demo audiences remember.

Next steps
Fork procamcalib or La Tabla just for the calibration wizard; port to JS with opencv.js bindings.

Keep depth handling off V1; focus on rock-solid homography + pinch-to-MIDI.

When you’re ready for advanced gestures, enable MediaPipe’s joint angles and swap the simple noteOn with MPE pressure/aftertouch.

That path will get your interactive projector from proof-of-concept to a polished eight-pad musical instrument fast—without getting stuck in calibration weeds.
